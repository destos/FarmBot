FarmBot Frontend
=======

The FarmBot web frontend consists of a graphical interface where the user can drag and drop desired plants into a map view, thus designing their farm or garden. The interface will also allow the user to set each plant's "grow specifications", view and modify the schedule of operations, display data overlays on the map view, and view and manipulate analytics data graphically. For an in-depth description and interface mockups, see the FarmBot white paper starting on page 23. http://www.scribd.com/doc/169536137/FarmBot-Humanity-s-Open-Source-Automated-Precision-Farming-Machine#page=23
